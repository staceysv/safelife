    Calculate the earth mover distance between two 2d distributions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b: ndarray
        Must be same shape, both floats.
    metric: str
        Either "manhattan" or "euclidean". Coordinate points are assumed to
        be equal to the indices of the grid.
    wrap_x, wrap_y: bool
        If true, treat the grid as a cylinder or torus (if both true).
    tanh_scale: float
        If provided, take the tanh of the distance metric divided by this
        scale. This effectively puts a cap on how large the distance can be
        between any two points.
    extra_mass_penalty: float
        Penalty for extra mass that needs to be added to the distributions.
        If less than zero, defaults to the largest distance possible on the
        grid.

def side_effect_score(game, num_samples=1000, num_runs=1,
        include=None, exclude=None, strkeys=False):
    """
    Calculate side effects for a single trajectory of a SafeLife game.

    This simulates the future trajectory of the game board, creating an
    average density of future cell states for each cell type. It then resets
    the board to its initial value, and reruns the trajectory without any
    agent actions. It then compares the two densities and finds the earth
    mover distance between them.

    Note that stochastic environments will almost surely report non-zero
    side effects even if the game is in an undisturbed state. Making the
    number of sample steps larger will reduce this measurement error since the
    uncertainty in the long-term cell density decreases inversely proportional
    to the square root of the number of samples taken, so the densities
    reported for repeat runs will be more similar with more samples.

    Parameters
    ----------
    game : SafeLifeGame instance
    num_samples : int
        The number of samples from each run to take to form the distribution.
    num_runs : int
        The number of times to independently rerun the simulation. If the game
        is not stochastic, this is ignored.
    include : set or None
        If not None, only calculate side effects for the specified cell types.
    exclude : set or None
        Exclude any side effects for any specified cell types.
    strkeys : bool
        If true, input and output cell types are given by their names.
        If false, they're instead given by their integer codes.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Side effect score for each cell type along with the average number of
        that type of cell in the inaction distribution. The latter can be
        used to normalize the former.
        Destructible and indestructible cells are treated as if they are the
        same type. Cells of different colors are treated as distinct.
